CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: <TODO>
Your Name: <TODO>
Your SUNetID: <TODO: the part of your email before the @, not the number>

Overview
--------
I looked into displaying images as the background of my website but still facing difficulties. I'm still playing around with mongo but managed to create a database. The wiring for the database seems off and the program can't seem to access/find the database

Project Changes
---------------
I plan on having the background as an image of a guitar and having the buttons correspond to the strings. However, I can't seem to figure out how to paste an image as the background. This is likely going to cause me to seek office hours

Implementation Details
----------------------
The backend will handle two things: the comment section and the contact me form. Any messages for the comment section can be publicly displayed and is impossible to remove. The contact me form will store what the user says into a file on my local computer. The css styling will come last

External libraries and code
---------------------------
Express: this will enable me to connect the backend server to the front end code and store everything permanently

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Office hours and classmates on the aesthetics of the website

Anything else?
--------------
Have been out of town for two weekends and sick this week. I do plan on putting a lot of effort into this project and will find some computer/server to host the published website.
