Welcome to my personal website project space. 

The following code sets up a front-end layout styling to display all sorts of personal information. 
This project uses a local backend mongoDB to store comments
To repurpose this project for your own personal use, replace the files in the txt folder with your own personal information and reroute the code to your own database in the api folder
The entire project is build without using React. Although using React would've been faster to develop, the goal of this project is to further deepen my understanding of web development behind the scenes

There are no external libraries required to be installed

To run the project after pulling the code, simply start your backend database and navigate to index.js in public. From index.js, run "npm start" in the command terminal
Happy coding!
